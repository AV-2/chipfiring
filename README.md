This is a collection of files related to the master thesis "Chip Firing, Riemann-Roch and Brill-Noether Theory for Graphs", by Alejandro Vargas.

The main file is ChipFiring.pm, a perl module implementing: Dhar's burning algorithm, Iterated Dhar's burning algorithm for calculating reduced divisors, a function that checks whether a divisor is rank-1, and a function that exhaustively finds all the rank-1 divisors. 

A folder of examples with several programs that the thesis makes reference to.

A folder of extra files with a data-set and a copy of the thesis. In it there is a description of the algorithm used to find all the rank-1 divisors.
